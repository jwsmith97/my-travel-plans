In this lesson, I have learned how to work with remotes, work on another developers repository, and sync with a remote repository. It is very useful that this can be done, because when you are developing and using the git repository, it is nice to know that you can colaborate remotely with the repository. It would be very useful for projects where the people creating them may not all be together.
